# Object-Detection-and-Distance-Prediction-With-Speech-Output
<!--Title of the Project-->
Detecting objects, predicting their distance, and producing the corresponding audio output.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The project aims to develop an object detection and distance prediction system integrated with speech output functionality. Using computer vision techniques, the system detects objects in real-time captured through a camera feed. Additionally, it estimates the distance of detected objects from the camera. Upon detection, the system utilizes speech synthesis to provide auditory feedback, verbally informing the user about the identified objects and their respective distances. This application finds utility in assisting visually impaired individuals by enhancing their spatial awareness and facilitating navigation in indoor and outdoor environments.
## Features
